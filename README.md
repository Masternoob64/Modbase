# Modbase
I’m a 6th grader with honors and band, and I do Modding stuff in my free time. I’ve got experience with modding Wii and Xbox 360.I also work with Legacy software and Virtual Machines.
Over the next few months i will be adding modding tools,apps and stuff like firmware for 6th,7th and 8th gen home consoles
If anyone wants to recommend if i should add anything to the repo or help me out with expanding the repo.
To contact me email me at aarushgokaraju34@gmail.com. I will be starting a reddit thread soon
